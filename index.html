<h2>About us</h2>

<p>CompSoc exists to create a setting where like-minded computing enthusiasts can interact and socialise. Our core aim is to make the student experience more enjoyable for those with any interest in Computing and Computer Science. We run and arrange events such as beginner workshops, Capture The Flag events, Hackathons, and social events. With a keen openness to collaborating with other societies and external companies in order to increase the diversity of the activities that we offer.</p>

<p>We support the academics of not only Computer Science, but also Physics, Economics, and any other subjects that have a computing component. Our support includes hosting workshops in such topics as Java, Python, C, and computing-related mathematics, running drop-in sessions for questions, and much more. As well as supplementary talks from students, we also invite guests from industry to host talks and events that allow students to learn and ask questions about graduate schemes, jobs, and other opportunities.</p>

<p>As well as academic events, we host a number of socials for our members to get together. From our weekly Friday pub social, clich&eacute; Minecraft survival games and other gaming activities, events on our discord server, to getting involved with SU club nights with 80s 90s 00. There is always some type of social to get our members involved.</p>
